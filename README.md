The Bookstore Dataset is a comprehensive collection of data representing various books and their key attributes. 
This dataset is ideal for practicing data analysis, visualization, and manipulation using data science tools such as pandas. 
The project can be used to explore trends in book ratings, pricing strategies, and stock management.

Project Objectives

Data Cleaning: Handle missing or inconsistent data to maintain dataset integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to book ratings, categories, and pricing.

Data Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to show distributions and relationships between variables.

Categorical Analysis: Group books by price categories, star ratings, or genres to find patterns or recommendations for inventory management

Technologies Used

Python: For data processing and analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating visualizations
